Client work vs product work

How do we decide who will be on a particular team.

2 developers, designer, advisor for client manager
time frame: people that have just gotten funding, want MVP.
our definition of an MVP is a lot smaller.
what can we do in 6-8 weeks that we can do to test if this thing has legs?

urgency: building great things. drives creativity.

most demoralizing: can't release it for a long long time. 
can't get feedback on it, working in a vacuum.
