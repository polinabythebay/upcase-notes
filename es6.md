ES 6 notes

ES2015, ES6

next version of javascript
cleans up the language
nicer to write

currently running version5

all backed by a standard

ecma-script: formal specification
of javascript

-- some of them are available 
in browser

Thoughtbot.

Coffeescript: rule for writing
good javascript.

Change to use a good transpiler.

Not coffeescript, but es6.

no more coffeescript,
es6 all the way

Good clean es6 code: browser 
will catch up. 
when it doesn't, you can use that
transpilation

es6 = harmony

alt syntax.

main tool: babel: 6to5

es5 code that runs in any browser

sprokets has integration for babel.

try not to rebind, try to use const

Babel
	common.js
	writes things happen

The zen of python
	zen type statements that are true of the world

Ruby is super implicit and very few namespaces

Promises and Classes are first class citizens
maps, sets, symbols

decorators

//it's improving, catching up with other languages

es6 a thumbs up. babel is the hotness
